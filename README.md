# TrybeSmith API project

Project carried out during the Back-end module of Trybe's web development course, A RESTful API for a medieval items store in which it is possible to create, view, delete and update products, orders and users, developed with MySQL and MSC architecture (model -service-controller).

   <summary><strong>What was done</strong></summary></br>

   In this project I developed an API and a database for a medieval items store using Typescript and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
  
   In this application, it is possible to carry out the basic operations that can be done in a given database: `CRUD`.
  
   The application was developed with:

   - `Node.js`
   - `TypeScript`
   - `JWT`
   - `POO`
   - `MSC Architecture`
   - `docker`
   - `docker-compose`
   - `MySql`
   - `Express`;
